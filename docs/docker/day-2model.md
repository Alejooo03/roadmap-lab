# Docker Observations

## System Perspective

Docker changes how applications are thought about.

Instead of running programs directly on the operating system, services are packaged with their dependencies and executed in isolated environments.

---

## Containers vs Services

A container represents a running instance of a service.

Docker Compose groups multiple services into a single system, making orchestration simpler and more predictable.

---

## Key Learnings

- Containers are disposable; data should not be
- Volumes are essential for persistence
- Service separation improves scalability
- Infrastructure can be versioned like code

---

## Why This Matters

Understanding Docker at a system level allows building applications that are:

- Easier to deploy
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to scale

These principles are essential for production-ready systems.
