# Technical Learning Roadmap

This repository documents my hands-on learning process focused on
Linux systems, containerization, version control, and secure workflows.

The purpose of this project is to track concepts learned and skills developed,
without exposing sensitive system or infrastructure details.

---

##  Topics Covered

### Linux Fundamentals
- User and credential management
- Basic system hardening practices
- Command-line based workflows
- Understanding process behavior and permissions

---

### Containerization Concepts
- Understanding how containers differ from virtual machines
- Running isolated services without modifying the host system
- Managing container lifecycle (start, stop, remove)
- Observing how services behave inside isolated environments

The focus was on **conceptual understanding**, not deployment.

---

### Version Control & Git
- Initializing and managing repositories locally
- Using Git entirely from the command line
- Understanding staging, commits, and branches
- Connecting local repositories to remote platforms using secure authentication
- Publishing changes using a clean, reproducible workflow

---

### Secure Workflows
- Avoiding exposure of system-specific information
- Practicing minimal disclosure in public documentation
- Understanding why operational security matters even in learning environments

---

##  Purpose of This Repository

- Track technical growth over time
- Reinforce fundamentals through documentation
- Maintain OPSEC-aware public records
- Build habits aligned with real-world security practices

This repository will evolve as new topics and projects are explored.

---

##  Next Learning Goals

- Container configuration and persistence
- Automation concepts
- Controlled lab environments
- Documentation practices for technical clarity without overexposure
